				<br> As and when I recollect the glimpses of my memory, the co-operation extended by parents and students during this 25 year period, to unfold the present stature of Aditya with 50 institutions, 5000 employees and 50000 students will always be green. When chaos was ruling the minds of the parents during 80s regarding the future of their children in this competitive world, the thought of providing quality education had sprouted in my mind. In consultation with academicians of distinguished calibre, a well-knit network of educational institutions from KG to PG Level was established in succession year after year. The liberalised policy of the Government to allow establishment of Technical institutions on par with other states, had prompted Aditya to start at Surampalem, Engineering and Pharmacy Courses in an extensive 150 acres of land in lush green area with rich ambience. Professional Courses like Nursing and Teacher Training followed the suite. Silver Jubilee Year of inception is a red lettered event in the annals of Aditya. Aditya's deep involvement for enriching the knowledge of students and enhancing the quality of education is a constant endeavour.The present-day job market poses fresh challenges that need to be managed innovatively. Global business Incubation centre, Microsoft Innovation Centre, Technical Skill Development Institute, T-hub, Training and Placement Cell, GATE coaching etc., act as perfect vehicles for this.

			I wish you all the best.</p>

				<br>It brings me great joy to be calling myself an integral part of this coveted institution. My brother and I have witnessed it all when father toiled hard to structure this wonderful institution. The posterity would always look up to its lineage, not just the success, attitude and hard work involved to see the aspired results but also most importantly the journey that made it happen. And a beautiful journey means a strong thought. Today, Aditya is proud to claim responsibility for being the reason behind a revolution for the generation. As generations came, saw and conquered – Aditya helped transform all those ideas into thoughts and later into actions. A strong thought always stands the test of time and hence brings the best of that generation. And I strongly feel, wherever we may go, whatever generation may come and go, it’s the strong will and thought, which makes the true difference. And I am sure no milestone is really far off, if a team sincerely follows a strong ideology. Father proved it time and again and we are glad to follow his foot steps.Keeping in view the demands of the work environment which is beyond just knowledge and marks, a lot of emphasis is laid on the overall personality development of the students. Various clubs run by the students, events like VEDA (technical fest) and COLOURS (youth fest) etc. challenge the latent talent in the students and bring them to the fore.

				Finally a desire can change nothing, a decision can change something but a determination can change everything. For sure Aditya is strongly determined to provide its students a successful career

			Wish you good luck.</p>

				<br>With great powers comes great responsibility, this adage is my favourite line indeed for it succinctly puts across what educational institutions ought to do. And for an educational institution as mighty as Aditya, some serious responsibility lies on the shoulders for we not just mould careers but lives of individuals. There are great instances and cases where students join at the KG level and leave us only at the PG level, so they technically spend two decades trusting and believing brand Aditya. I am proud to say that we at Aditya, have always realized this and have performed our duties with utmost care and interest. Good words spread in a jiffy and certainly has been the case with us, for our campuses have been thronged by students and aspirants not just from our vicinity but other states too. With every passing day, responsibilities, expectations and demand has been increasing multifold and so has been our performance. Every single academic year, we have been making stupendous commencements both in results and introduction of new courses, thus pushing the envelope beyond our own imaginations. We have reached a phase, where the greatest challenge is ourselves and each time, we just want to get better.I am very delighted to express that the quality of Adityans is recognized by the employers who offer jobs to our students even before the announcement of the results. Our alumni are contributing in their professions and have earned senior positions in public & private sector nationally and internationally

			Keep going!</p>
